# Helper-Docs

These files are (hopefully) helpful with calculations when tuning your 3D printing experience.

I created the Tuning Tower spreadsheet based off the forumlas provided by the [Klipper devs](https://github.com/KevinOConnor/klipper) since
it was not intuitive for me to follow them.

The Volumetric spreadsheet was created by [Machael Laws (Teaching Tech)](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbgBDBrwsikmtoLqtpc59Bw), but it had a formula typo at the time
I first used it. This version is corrected.
