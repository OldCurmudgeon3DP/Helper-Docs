# Helper-Docs

These files are (hopefully) helpful with calculations when tuning your 3D printing experience.

I created the Tuning Tower spreadsheet based off the forumlas provided by the [Klipper devs](https://github.com/KevinOConnor/klipper) since
it was not intuitive for me to follow them.

The Volumetric spreadsheet was created by [Michael Laws (Teaching Tech)](https://teachingtechyt.github.io/), but it had a formula typo at the time
I first used it. This version is corrected. He has since created a webpage with the calculations and I updated the link in this file.

The Extrusion Multiplier sheet takes measurements from [Luke Hatfield's work here](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3220015) and does the legwork.
